OpenCV OpticalFlow Showcase
===========================

## About
This is sample code for trying methods of computer vision called [Optical Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow) casually with [OpenCV](http://opencv.org).

This is better version of 'samples/python2/opt_flow.py' included in OpenCV.
Features:
- Switchable to 4 type of optical flow methods.
- Not accumulating 'flow' for easy understanding. 
- Flipping video image horizontally for the use with webcam.
- Summarized code for each methods.
- (new) Raspberry Pi support.

## Example

- Gunnar-Farneback method: By HSV

![HSV](https://github.com/daisukelab/cv_opt_flow/blob/master/sample_result/hsv.png "HSV") ![HSV SRC](https://github.com/daisukelab/cv_opt_flow/blob/master/sample_result/hsv_src.png "HSV Source")

- Gunnar-Farneback method: By lines

![LINES](https://github.com/daisukelab/cv_opt_flow/blob/master/sample_result/lines.png "LINES") ![LINES SRC](https://github.com/daisukelab/cv_opt_flow/blob/master/sample_result/lines_src.png "LINES Source")

- Gunnar-Farneback method: By warping

![WARP](https://github.com/daisukelab/cv_opt_flow/blob/master/sample_result/warp.png "WARP") ![WARP SRC](https://github.com/daisukelab/cv_opt_flow/blob/master/sample_result/warp_src.png "WARP Source")

- Lucas-Kanade method

## Tested Environment
(Mac)
- MacOS X El Capitan
- python 2.7.10
- OpenCV3 3.1.0

(Raspberry Pi)
- Raspberry Pi 2
- Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS (trusty)
- python 2.7.6
- OpenCV3 3.0.0

## Running this sample
For Mac/PC, simply run main.py.

    $ python main.py

For Raspberry Pi, run raspi_main.py.

    $ python raspi_main.py

Usage will be shown as below.

    Hit followings to switch to:
    1 - Dense optical flow by HSV color image (default);
    2 - Dense optical flow by lines;
    3 - Dense optical flow by warped image;
    4 - Lucas-Kanade method.

    Hit 's' to save image.

    Hit 'f' to flip image horizontally.

    Hit ESC to exit.

* For Mac/PC, click on the preview window to enter commands.
